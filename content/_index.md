### Attention femboy luster!

The majority of our generation spends hours each day on their phones.

Enslaved by algorithms and porn, which is just as destructive as the phone.

This hinders people from pursuing meaningful hobbies/interests, and keeps them from living a fulfilling life.

I would like to meet (befriend) other young people and hear of their projects and goals. I'll gladly help where I can.


If you're up to that:
